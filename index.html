    <h1>Social Media</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <b>Social media</b> are interactive technologies that allow the <a href="">creation</a> or <a href="">sharing/exchange</a> of information, ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression via <a href="">virtual communities</a>  and <a href="">networks [1][2]</a>. While challenges to the definition of social media arise <a href="">[3][4]</a>  due to the broad variety of stand-alone and built-in social-media services currently available, there are some common features: <a href=""> <a href="">[2]</a> </a>

    <ol>
        <li>Social media are interactive <a href="">Web 2.0 Internet</a>-based applications. <a href="">[2][5][6]</a>.</li><br>
        <li> <a href="">User-generated</a>  content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through all online interactions—is the lifeblood of social media. <a href="">[2][5]</a> </li><br>
        <li>Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the <a href="">social-media organization.[2][7]</a> </li><br>
        <li>Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups. <a href="">[2][7]</a> </li><br>
    </ol>

    <p>Users usually access social media services via <a href="">web-based apps</a> on <a href="">desktops</a> and <a href="">laptops</a>, or <a href="">download services</a> that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., <a href="">smartphones</a> and <a href="">tablets</a> ). As users engage with these <a href="">electronic</a> services, they create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify user-generated content or self-curated content posted online.[1] Additionally, social media are used to document memories; learn about and explore things; advertise oneself; and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites. <a href="">[8]</a> This changing relationship between human and technology is the focus of the emerging field of <a href="">technoself studies</a>.</p>

    <p>Some of the most popular social media websites, with over 100 million registered users, include <a href="">Facebook</a> (and its associated <a href="">Facebook Messenger), TikTok, WeChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, Twitter, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba,</a> and <a href="">LinkedIn.</a>  Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include: <a href="">YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, VK, Microsoft Teams,</a> and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.</p>

    <p>Many social media outlets differ from <a href="">traditional media </a>(e.g., <a href="">print magazines and newspapers</a>, and <a href="">TV</a> and <a href="">radio broadcasting</a>) in a variety of ways, including quality,[9] <a href="">reach, frequency</a>, usability, immediacy, and permanence.[10] Additionally, social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system, i.e., many sources to many receivers, while traditional media outlets operate under a <a href="">monologic transmission model</a> (i.e., one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to an entire city. <a href="">[11]</a></p>
